Implement a method that prints all dates between two given years that remain the same if numbers of the date are reversed.

Method signature:
static void printBonusDatesBetween(int fromYear, int toYear)

It should print dates in interval from fromYear (inclusive) to toYear (exclusive) that satisfy the condition.

For example, calling printBonusDatesBetween(2010, 2015) should print:
2010-01-02
2011-11-02
